# Linear Delta Multipurpose Machine
This is the documentation of how I built my own Linear Delta Machine that can be used for many different applications depending on the end effector that we put into it. This could be used for example as a 3D printer if you add the extruder, a plotter if you add a pen at the end of it or a pick and place machine like the one presented in the demos. This machine was built at 42 Robotics which is the hardware lab of [42 School Silicon Valley](https://www.42.us.org/).

### Repository content
* Marlin Firmware - contains the firmware loaded into the Arduino board.
* Res - contains the images and videos of the project.
* STL-files - contains the 3D models of the 3D printed parts of the machine.
* Test-files - contains files used to test the machine at different stages.
